# Portrait of a classical lazy dev

- 👋 Hi, I’m @Cat-dll
- 👀 I’m interested in programming in C (for video game) and other engineering stuff :O
- 🌱 I’m currently learn everything. 
- 💞️ I am looking to work with others who could join my development team or just collaborate in my projects!
- 📫 How to reach me: My email, but I am much more "responsive" on my discord: _Cat.obj#1057
