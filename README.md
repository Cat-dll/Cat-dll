# Portrait of yet another French Canadian developer

- 👋 Hi, I’m @Cat-dll
- 👀 I’m interested in programming in C (oriented video game) :O
- 🌱 I’m currently learning "How to make a good game engine" :P 
- 💞️ I am looking to work with others who could join my development team or just collaborate in my projects!
- 📫 How to reach me: My email, but I am much more responsive on my discord: Legacy Thing.#1057
